      <description>Bike algorithm I like riding a bike. Because my knee are not healthy now, I cannot ride a bike much. However, even little riding makes me feel good. Today it occurs to me if I am addicted at riding a bike. During riding a bike, I was thinking about the algorithm commands me. Silly me thought it is funny.
Thus, I tried to make a flowchart of the algorithm. Tried to use some online service to draw it.</description>
