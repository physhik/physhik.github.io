      <description>Judgement Day 
It is the first time I did not post for 4 days. I was too busy to prepare for the meetup this week. The day before yesterday meetup topic was the reinforcement learning as I mentioned at previous post. It is not a long research paper, but includes 143 references. Ah, not my favorite. This A Brief Survey of Deep Reinforcement Learning did not explain the detail of what I am interested in.</description>
