      <description>Algorithm

This is mainly a Python-implementation of the book, Cracking the coding interview, which includes examples and chosen exercises. Since I have studied algorithm of programming with Python and the Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python, I would review about them, too.

Actually, I started to solve the exercises of the chapter 8 (dynamic programming) because I thought I have a hole that Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python does not contain it.</description>
