      <description>Single neuron still has a lot to say In the post of the first neural network tutorial, we studied a perceptron as a simple supervised learning machine. The perceptron is an amazing structure to understanding inference.
In the post of the first neural network tutorial, I said I would leave you to find the objective function and and draw the plot of it. I just introduce here.
Objective function and its contour plot.</description>

      <description>I assume that the readers know the Bayes&#39; rule already. If you are not familiar to it, read any kind of textbook about probability, data science, and machine learning. I recommend the book, which I learned Bayes&#39; rule. Bayesians say that you cannot do inference without making assumptions. Thus, Bayesians also use probabilities to describe inferences. The author in the chapter 2 introduces some rules of probability theory and introduces more about assumptions in inference in the chapter 3.</description>
