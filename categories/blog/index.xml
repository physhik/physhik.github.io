      <title>New Blog Theme</title>

      <description>I decided to use my own domain instead of renting the /github.io/, and also to insert Google adsense in my blog if possible. Even if I updated my blog only 10 times since Oct, 2017, the number of visitors and their sessions were steady by Google analysis. I appreicate the interest on my posts. Recently I started updating my blog again, and want to see the more industrial analytic result. At least I am sure the profit from the adsense will cover the cost for the domain.</description>

      <description>Add mathjax The another good thing of Jekyll blog1 is that we can finally use math formula in it.
$$ \nabla \times \vec{B} = 0 $$
There was troubles when I tried to include some formula in Github README.md file.
Haixing Hu&amp;rsquo;s blog was helpful to do it.
Need to fix 3 kinds of files in total.
1. make a new mathjax_support.html file in _include folder _include folder saves html formats to use in your layout files.</description>

      <title>Adding Disqus to a Jekyll Blog</title>

      <description>Github is a fantastic space for someone like me to try to learn something new.
This time I have built a blog powered by jekyll and Github. This posting is targetting a novice who especially used a theme, and who is trying to add a disqus in the blog. Hope it helps them not to experience the trials and errors I had.
I found jekyll homepage and Sechter&amp;rsquo;s blog good. I guess you would barely need to look into my posting after going thorough these two websites.</description>

      <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>

      <description>Youâ€™ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.</description>
